I'm **@Targazh**, i a cybersecurity enthusiast since 2019. I'm as senior SOC analyst and malware reverse engineer.

If you are new to cybersecurity read below. I want to teach you the "Dunning Kruger Effect" ðŸ˜Š.

![Alt Text](/attachements/dunning_krugger.png)

This representation is widely used on the internet. But don't take it too seriously. Just enjoy every little step you make. Unlike the emoji in this graph, skills and knowledge are absolutely not related to age. Some people may get stuck in the valley of despair or at the peak of confidence in the beginning of the chart. They might be the most difficult people to work with ðŸ˜Š.

Cybersecurity is overwhelming, it is a collection of a lot of specialization. Each specialization is made of other specialization. Take for example the reverse engineering. It is a "niche" in itself, but malware reverse engineer and vulnerability researcher is not the same job !

To find your way, just practice ! Don't loose too much time on reading courses or certification. The best way, for me, is to practice. And we have a tremendous luck compare to our eldest ! 

We have internet with a lot of very good website and documentations : rootme, htb, openanalysis, tryhackme, crackme.one, exploit.education, azeria-labs, cyberdefenders, cryptohack.org etc .. and a lot of really precious books (pratical malware analysis, practical reverse engineering etc..). Don't hesitate to read writes-up, you can find a lot of them on github. If you prefer the video format, you have a lot of them on youtube and twitch .

That to say, the path demands a lot of commitment. It can be difficult to find your goal but when you will find it you will be rewarded. 

Keep going, It will be a long journey but what a great journey !
