> Hi, welcome to my documentation website. I just want to share a bit of knowledge about cybersecurity. This website does not aim to be perfect nor without any mistakes. But if any of what I wrote can be useful for someone, I will be very happy for that! 

<ins>I regularly use emoji with my notes. You can find below the legend that i use : <ins>

🕵️ : Analysis

💰 : finding

💣 : Exploitation phase

🚧 : Warning / Carefull

Don't hesitate to rate my articles by a 👎 or a 👍. That will guide me for my other articles. 

Hey, by the way, i'm not a native english speaker. But you will discover that pretty quickly 😊.

<ins>If you are __new to cybersecurity__ read below. I would like to talk to you about the "Dunning Kruger Effect"<ins> 😊.

This representation is widely used on the internet. But don't take it too seriously. Just enjoy every little step you make. Unlike the emoji in this graph, skills and knowledge are absolutely not related to age. Some people may get stuck in the valley of despair or at the peak of confidence in the beginning of the chart.

Cybersecurity is overwhelming, it is a collection of a lot of expertise. Each expertise is made of other specialization. Take for example the reverse engineering. It is a "niche" in itself, but malware reverse engineer and vulnerability researcher is not the same job !

To find your way, just practice ! Don't loose too much time on reading courses or certification. The best way, for me, is to practice. And we have a tremendous luck compare to our eldest ! 

We have internet with a lot of very good website and documentations : rootme, htb, openanalysis, tryhackme, crackme.one, exploit.education, azeria-labs, cyberdefenders, cryptohack.org etc .. and a lot of really precious books (pratical malware analysis, practical reverse engineering etc..). Don't hesitate to read writes-up, you can find a lot of them on github. If you prefer the video format, you have a lot of them on youtube and twitch .

That to say, the path demands a lot of commitment. It can be difficult to find your goal but when you will find it you will be rewarded. 

Keep going, It will be a long journey but what a great journey !
